# Data Visualization in R - course case study

January 2021

A case study of Korean Covid data analysis. Focusing on the questions: 

1. If I am a man does it mean I have higher chances to die?
2. If I live in a province with a bigger population does it mean I have higher chances to get the virus
because my province would have more confirmed cases?
3. If I am young does it mean I will get better sooner, than somebody who is old?
